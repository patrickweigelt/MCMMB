## Overview

- Why R?
- What is R?
- Basics of R & RStudio 
- Where to get help with R  
- R Data science resources
- R & You

## Why R?

- Transparency
- Reproducibility
- Open science & lowering barriers  

## What is R? (part I)

- Statistical computing environment  
    + Basic statistics (e.g. ANOVA, T-tests) 
    + Complex modeling (machine learning, Bayesian stats, simulations...) 
- Database manager  

## What is R? (part II)  

- Graphic design    
- GIS 
- Version control (via Github, etc.)  
- Publisher (basic word processing, web pages, scientific articles, theses, books...)

## Basics of R & RStudio

Download R :<http://www.r-cran.org>  

Download RStudio: <http://www.rstudio.com>

Other options besides RStudio: Jupyter notebooks, Rodeo  


## Basics of R & RStudio  

- Integrated environment between scripts, output, figures, etc. 
- Easy to configure
- Large online user community for help
- Lots of online courses (e.g. Datacamp, Coursera...)

## Where to get help with R  

- Cookbook for R <http://www.cookbook-r.com/>
- Stackoverflow <http://www.stackoverflow.com>
- Quick-R <https://www.statmethods.net/>
- or do an online search (Google, DuckDuckGo) : 
    * 'R package/function name error message'
    * 'R how to remove every third line from a data.frame'  
- Look for local or university user groups (via Slack,Twitter, etc.)  


    
## R Data science resources  

- Overview of R packages <https://github.com/rstudio/RStartHere>

- R for Data Science (by Hadley Wickham) <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/>

- The basics and a lot more <http://ohi-science.org/news/Resources-for-R-and-Data-Science>

- Guide for reproducible code <https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf> 


## R & You

- Tools you need to acquire and strengthen as a graduate student:    
    * Think critically (identify & assess problems)    
    * Solve problems    
    * Communicate problems and possible solutions  
    * R is one of many tools, but it's also becoming increasingly marketable (outside of science too!)
